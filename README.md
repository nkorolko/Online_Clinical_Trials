# Covariate-adaptive optimization in online clinical
trials 

State-of-the-art methods for covariate-adaptive randomization

Pharmaceutical companies spend tens of billions of dollars each year to operate multi-year clinical
trials needed for the approval of new drugs. We present a novel covariate-adaptive optimization
algorithm for online allocation in clinical trials that leverages robust mixed-integer optimization.
Our approach allocates groups with on average 3{4 times lower discrepancy in means (or 1.4
times, in the case of multiple controlled covariates) than those produced by covariate-adaptive
randomization methods. In simulated experiments involving both single (and multiple) covariates,
our method achieves a desired level of statistical power at a sample size that is on average
35% smaller (14% smaller, respectively) relative to state-of-the-art covariate-adaptive randomization
approaches. Correspondingly, we expect that our approach could substantially reduce both
the duration and operating costs of a clinical trial. This computationally tractable assignment
mechanism is an effcient alternative to existing covariate-adaptive randomization methods.
